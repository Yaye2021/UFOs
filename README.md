# UFOs

## OVERVIEW

### Purpose

The purpose of the job is to create a JavaScript file with visual functionality to display the data of UFO sightings in US, including countries, cities, states and type. The idea is to build a web page with the Danas UFOs article, the filters and the information displayed in a table with a cleaner and attractive look.

## RESULTS
Once created the webpage it looks like this:

![Title](images/Imagen1.png)

On the top of, we can find Danas article, and scrolling down, the table without applying a filter, with all the results of UFOs sighting from January 1st 2010 to January 13th 2010.

On the left side, are the filters in order to get the required information. The user can apply one of the filters, for example, just date, city, state, country and shape. 
    
    Example 1: Filtering only by City= “el cajon”

Or the filters can be used simultaneously, for example, by date and state, or country and shape, as shown below:

    Example 2: Date=1/4/2010 and State= CA

    Example 3: Country= US and Shape = triangle

This functionality gives the user the facility to search specific information they are looking for.

## SUMMARY

### -Drawback
After finishing the webpage, one drawback is that all the information is displayed in the browser, making a little bit uncomfortable to look. If the data in the original file grows, just scrolling down to get to the end is not adequate for the user experience.

### -Recommendation 1
Due to the disadvantage mentioned earlier, is recommended to split the information in various pages, for example, one page with the ten first chunk of data and so on with the following ones.

### -Recommendation 2
Because the user couldn´t  be able to see all the data that is displayed in the page, is more comfortable to include combos in every filter space,  in order to see if the date, country, state, or shape that we are looking for, is available in the stored information.
